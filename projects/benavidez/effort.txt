Converted from V3 to V5. Fixed performance issues that caused
the visualization to run very slowly after clicking too many
buttons. Fixed issue with color mismatches in the legend and map
fills. Swapped out all the buttons for one slider. Prepared a more 
complete dataset ranging from 2000 to 2019 that doesn't have as many
empty data values as the original. Made it clear that we are using 
median AQI (the orignal visualization didn't specify). Centered the 
maps, input buttons/slider, and legends. Changed the color scheme 
for the asthma map to indicate that a higher value is bad.
